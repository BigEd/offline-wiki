      If you're reading this in the distant future, say, 2012, and you aren't preparing
      for the imminent apocalyptic scenarios (or if you are, that would be cool too), you 
      should totally email me at antimatter15@gmail.com.
      
      If you're reading this in the post-apocalyptic world, or if for some odd reason
      skynet was actually powered by Amazon EC2 during the great outage of April 21st,
      2011, and somehow the malfunctioning of the cloud resulted in the prolonging of 
      human existence, then you should still email me because there might be a decent
      chance that I would have survived the chaos which ensued during the eventless
      apocalypse.
      
      And in case the future me ever reads this. Hi. I'm you from the past. It would be
      pretty interesting to meet you. But regardless, I would probably be disappointed
      in whatever you've done because life seems to continue according to my diminishing
      intelligence hypothesis. Probably, you're at least thinking that you're a lot dumber
      than you were when I wrote this, and wondering why I consider myself a different person
      when existing in different times. However, the people who aren't me who might happen
      to read this document will probably find it really weird that some guy talks to himself
      about the future and past and is probably insane or suffering some odd self diagnosed
      inferiority complex instigated by the two time rejection from an unnamed institution
      for people interested in science and technology. But saying that would make future me
      feel weird as well as future non-mes.

        This paragraph is still in the process of being rewritten. I'm actually rewriting it now, but there's a good chance that these words won't be the same words as the final. I'm not exactly sure I'm writing these non-final words instead of writing some more final words, but I don't feel frankly in the mood to write final words.
